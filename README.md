Bench of small Qt applications made for fun.

## Composition

As you can see, this is not a big project, but more than one little projects.

## Compilation

For any of the projects, run the following commands from the project's folder :
```txt
$ mkdir build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ ./<NameOfProject>
```
with `NameOfProject` the project you're compiling (use `ls` if unsure)
